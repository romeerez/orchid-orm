# Relation queries

Here is how to load related records by using a record object (supported by all kinds of relations):

The resulting record of the `belongsTo` and `hasOne` relation can be undefined if the `required` option was not set in the table class.

```ts
const book = await db.book.find(1);

// type of argument is { authorId: number }
const author = await db.book.author(book);

// type of argument is { id: number }
const books = await db.author.books(author);

// additional query methods can be applied:
const partialAuthor = await db.book.author(book).select('id', 'name');

const countBooks: number = await db.author
  .books(author)
  .where({ title: 'Kobzar' })
  .count();

const authorHasBooks: boolean = await db.author.books(author).exists();
```

It's possible to chain relations query without providing a loaded record (supported by all kinds of relations):

```ts
// find book and load author:
const author = await db.book.find(1).author;

// find many books and load their authors:
const manyAuthors = await db.book.where({ id: { in: [1, 2, 3] } }).author;

// filter both books and the authors and load authors in one query:
const filteredAuthors = await db.book
  .where({ booksCondition: '...' })
  .author.where({ authorCondition: '...' });

// find the author and load their books:
const booksFromOneAuthor = await db.author.find(1).books;

// find many authors and load their books:
const booksFromManyAuthors = await db.author.where({ id: { in: [1, 2, 3] } })
  .books;

// filter both authors and books and load books in one query:
const filteredBooks = await db.author
  .where({ authorCondition: '...' })
  .books.where({ booksCondition: '...' });
```

The relation can be used in `.whereExists` (supported by all kinds of relations):

```ts
// load books which have author
await db.book.whereExists('author');

// load authors which have books
await db.authors.whereExists('book');

// additional query methods can be applied in a callback:
await db.book.whereExists('author', (q) =>
  q.where({ 'author.name': 'Olexiy' }),
);
```

The relation can be used in `.join`.

Supported by all kinds of relations, but it is not suggested for `hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` because data will be duplicated.

```ts
await db.book.join('author').select(
  // column without a table is for the current book table
  'title',
  // select the column of a joined table
  'author.name',
);

// author name will be repeated for each book title:
await db.author.join('books').select('name', 'books.title');

// additional query methods can be applied in a callback:
await db.book
  .join('author', (q) => q.where({ 'author.name': 'Olexiy' }))
  .select('title', 'author.name');
```

The relation can be loaded using `.select` and related records will be added to each record.

`belongsTo` and `hasOne` will add an object (can be `null` if not found).

`hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` will add an array of objects.

For `hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` this works better than `join` because it won't lead to duplicative data.

Use the name of relation to load full records:

```ts
// if the `required` option is not set in the table class,
// type of author will be Author | null
const booksWithAuthor: Book & { author: Author } = await db.book
  .select('*', 'author')
  .take();

const authorWithBooks: Author & { books: Book[] } = await db.author
  .select('*', 'books')
  .take();
```

To load specific fields or to apply `where`, `order`, `limit`, and other methods,
a relation can be selected by adding a callback to the select list:

```ts
type BookResult = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  author: {
    id: number;
    name: number;
  };
};

const bookWithAuthor: BookResult = await db.book
  .select('id', 'title', {
    author: (q) => q.author.select('id', 'name'),
  })
  .take();

type AuthorResult = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  books: {
    id: number;
    title: string[];
  };
};

const authorWithBooks: AuthorResult = await db.author
  .select('id', 'name', {
    books: (q) =>
      q.books
        .select('id', 'title')
        .where(...conditions)
        .order('title')
        .limit(5),
  })
  .take();
```

All relations are supporting `exists` in select (get a boolean to know whether related records exist or not):

```ts
type Result = {
  id: number;
  hasTags: boolean;
  hasSpecificTag: boolean;
};

const result: Result = await db.post.select('id', {
  hasTags: (q) => q.tags.exists(),
  hasSpecificTag: (q) => q.tags.where({ name: 'specific' }).exists(),
});
```

For `hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` the select can handle aggregation queries such as `count`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, and `avg`:

```ts
type Result = {
  id: number;
  tagsCount: number;
  tagsCommaSeparated: string;
};

const result: Result = await db.post
  .select('id', {
    tagsCount: (q) => q.tags.count(),
    tagsCommaSeparated: (q) => q.tags.stringAgg('name', ', '),
  })
  .take();
```

## create update delete

`Orchid ORM` makes it very easy to do modifications of related records,
it allows building a query chain to modify related records,
it supports nested creates and updates.

For `belongsTo` and `hasOne` you can do only one thing per each relation.
For instance, create an author while creating a book, or connect the book to the author while creating it.
But not create and connect at the same time.

For `hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` you can combine multiple commands for a single relation:
while updating the author you can create new books, connect some books, and delete books by conditions.

## create from relation query

It is possible to chain querying of the table with the creating of its relation, in a such way:

```ts
await db.author.find(1).books.create({
  title: 'Book title',
});

// post hasAndBelongsToMany tags
await db.post.find(1).tags.create({
  name: 'tag name',
});
```

This is possible for `hasOne`, `hasMany`, and `hasAndBelongsToMany`, but this is disabled for `belongsTo` and `hasOne`/`hasMany` with the `through` option.

This is only allowed to perform create based on a query that returns one record, so you have to use methods `find`, `findBy`, `take`, or similar.

`db.post.tags.create` or `db.post.where(...).tags.create` won't work because multiple posts are returned in these queries.

Using `createMany` or `createRaw` in such chained queries is not implemented yet, but it's in the plans.

Because the `create` method is designed to return a full record by default,
in the case when a record is not found by the condition it will throw `NotFoundError`, even when using `findOptional`:

```ts
// will throw if no post with such a title
await db.post
  .findBy({ title: 'non-existing' })
  .tags.create({ name: 'tag name' });

// will throw either
const tag = await db.post
  .findByOptional({ title: 'non-existing' })
  .tags.create({ name: 'tag name' });

// we can be sure that the tag is always returned
tag.name;
```

If you want `undefined` to be returned instead of throwing `NotFoundError`,
use `takeOptional()` to get `RecordType | undefined`, or `count()` to get 0 for not found and 1 for a created.

`hasAndBelowToMany` relation will throw `NotFoundError` either way,
to make sure we're not creating hanging records not connected to other records.

```ts
const tagOrUndefined = await db.author
  .findByOptional({ name: 'Author name' })
  .books.takeOptional()
  .create({ name: 'Book title' });

const createdCount = await db.author
  .findByOptional({ name: 'Author name' })
  .books.count()
  .create({ name: 'Book title' });

// hasAndBelongsToMany will throw when not found anyway:
await db.post
  .findByOptional({ title: 'Post title' })
  .tags.takeOptional()
  .create({ name: 'tag name' });
```

## delete from relation query

Delete related records from a relation query chain.

This is supported for all kinds of relations only except `belongsTo`.

```ts
// delete all books of the author
// `delete` method requires where statement, empty where is here as a sanity check
await db.author.find(1).books.where().delete();

// delete specific books of specific authors
await db.author
  .where({ name: 'author name' })
  .books.where({ title: 'book title' })
  .delete();

// TypeScript will highlight the `delete` method
// because deleting a `belongsTo` relation is not allowed
await db.book.find(1).author.delete();
```

## nested create

Create a record with related records all at once:

This will run two insert queries in a transaction, (three insert queries in the case of `hasAndBelongsToMany`).

For relations with the `through` option need to nest `creates` explicitly.

If a post table has many tags through "postTags", needs to create a post, inside it create postTags, and inside it create tags.

But if you do the same relation with `hasAndBelongsToMany`, you can create tags directly from post creation,
and the postTag record in between will be created automatically.

```ts
const book = await db.book.create({
  title: 'Book title',
  author: {
    create: {
      name: 'Author',
    },
  },
});

const author = await db.author.create({
  name: 'Author',
  books: {
    create: [{ title: 'Book 1' }, { title: 'Book 2' }, { title: 'Book 3' }],
  },
});

// post hasMany tags through postTags
// we cannot create tags directly
const post = await db.post.create({
  title: 'Post title',
  postTags: {
    create: [
      {
        tag: {
          create: {
            name: 'tag name',
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

Nested create is supported when creating many as well:

```ts
const books = await db.book.createMany([
  {
    title: 'Book 1',
    author: {
      create: {
        name: 'Author 1',
      },
    },
  },
  {
    title: 'Book 2',
    author: {
      create: {
        name: 'Author 2',
      },
    },
  },
]);
```

## create from update

Create related records when doing an update:

For `belongsTo`, `hasOne`, and `hasMany` it is available when updating one record, there must be `find`, `findBy`, or `take` before the update.

For `hasAndBelongsToMany` this will connect all found records for the update with all created records.

The `hasOne` relation will nullify the `foreignKey` of the previous related record if exists, so it has to be nullable.

```ts
await db.book.find(1).update({
  title: 'update book title',
  author: {
    create: {
      name: 'new author',
    },
  },
});

await db.author.find(1).update({
  name: 'update author name',
  books: {
    create: [{ title: 'new book 1' }, { title: 'new book 2' }],
  },
});

// this will connect all 3 posts with 2 tags
await db.post.where({ id: { in: [1, 2, 3] } }).update({
  tags: {
    create: [{ name: 'new tag 1' }, { name: 'new tag 2' }],
  },
});
```

For `belongsTo` when updating multiple records, the `create` option will connect the new record with all updating records:

```ts
await db.book.where({ id: { in: [1, 2, 3] } }).update({
  title: 'update book title',
  author: {
    // all books will be connected with this author:
    create: {
      name: 'new author',
    },
  },
});
```

## connect related records

Connect records when creating:

This will search a record by provided where condition, throw `NotFoundError` if not found, and update the referring column.

Supported when creating multiple records as well.

```ts
const book = await db.book.create({
  title: 'Book title',
  author: {
    connect: {
      name: 'Author',
    },
  },
});

const author = await db.author.create({
  name: 'Author name',
  books: {
    connect: [
      {
        title: 'Book 1',
      },
      {
        title: 'Book 2',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## connect or create

The `connectOrCreate` option will try to find a record to connect with, and it will create the record if not found.

This is also supported when creating multiple records.

`belongsTo` and `hasOne` relations are accepting object `{ where: ..., create ... }`:

```ts
const result = await db.book.create({
  title: 'Book title',
  author: {
    connectOrCreate: {
      where: {
        name: 'Author',
      },
      create: {
        name: 'Author',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

`hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` relations are accepting an array of `{ where: ..., create ... }`:

```ts
const result = await db.author.create({
  name: 'Author',
  books: {
    connectOrCreate: [
      {
        where: { title: 'Book 1' },
        create: { title: 'Book 1' },
      },
      {
        where: { title: 'Book 2' },
        create: { title: 'Book 2' },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## disconnect related records

This will delete join table records for `hasAndBelongsToMany`, and nullify the `foreignKey` column for the other kinds (the column has to be nullable).

Also supported when creating multiple records.

For `belongsTo` and `hasOne` relations write `disconnect: true`:

```ts
await db.book.where({ title: 'book title' }).update({
  author: {
    disconnect: true,
  },
});
```

`hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` relations are accepting filter conditions.

```ts
await db.post.where({ title: 'post title' }).update({
  tags: {
    disconnect: {
      name: 'some tag',
    },
  },
});
```

It may be an array of conditions:

Each provided condition may match 0 or more related records, there is no check to find exactly one.

```ts
await db.post.where({ title: 'post title' }).update({
  tags: {
    disconnect: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }],
  },
});
```

## set related records

Set related records when updating.

For `hasOne` and `hasMany` it is available only when updating one record, so the query should have `find`, `findBy`, or `take` before the update.

For `hasOne` and `hasMany`, if there was a related record before the update, its `foreignKey` column will be updated to `NULL`, so it has to be nullable.

In the `hasAndBelongsToMany` relation this will delete all previous rows of the join table and create new ones.

```ts
const author = await db.author.find(1);

// this will update the book with the author's id from the given object
await db.book.find(1).update({
  author: {
    set: author,
  },
});

// this will find the first author with given conditions to use their id
await db.book.find(2).update({
  author: {
    set: { name: 'author name' },
  },
});

// TypeScript error because of the need to use `findBy` instead of `where`:
await db.author.where({ id: 1 }).update({
  books: {
    set: { id: 1 },
  },
});

await db.author.find(1).update({
  books: {
    // all found books with such titles will be connected to the author
    set: { title: 'book title' },
  },
});

await db.author.find(1).update({
  books: {
    // array of conditions can be provided:
    set: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }],
  },
});
```

## delete related records

Deletes related records.

For the `belongsTo` relation it will update `foreignKey` to `NULL` before deleting.

`hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` are accepting the same conditions as the `.where` method to delete only matching records, as an object or as an array of objects.

Empty `{}` or `[]` will delete all related records.

```ts
await db.book.find(1).update({
  author: {
    delete: true,
  },
});

await db.author.find(1).update({
  account: {
    // delete author book by conditions
    delete: { title: 'book title' },
  },
});

await db.author.find(1).update({
  account: {
    // array of conditions:
    delete: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }],
  },
});
```

## nested update

Update related records.

`belongsTo` and `hasOne` accept objects with data for the update.

`hasMany` and `hasAndBelongsToMany` accepts `where` conditions and `data` objects. `where` can be an object or an array of objects.

```ts
await db.book.find(1).update({
  author: {
    update: {
      name: 'new name',
    },
  },
});

await db.author.find(1).update({
  books: {
    update: {
      where: {
        title: 'old book title',
      },
      data: {
        title: 'new book title',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

When updating multiple records, all their related records will be updated:

```ts
await db.book.where({ id: { in: [1, 2, 3] } }).update({
  author: {
    update: {
      name: 'new name',
    },
  },
});

await db.author.where({ id: [1, 2, 3] }).update({
  books: {
    update: {
      where: {
        title: 'old book title',
      },
      data: {
        title: 'new book title',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## upsert: update or insert

Update related record if exists, and create if it doesn't.

Only available for `belongsTo` and `hasOne` relations.

Supported when updating multiple records for `belongsTo`.

```ts
await db.book.find(1).update({
  author: {
    upsert: {
      update: {
        name: 'new name',
      },
      create: {
        name: 'new name',
        email: 'some@email.com',
      },
    },
  },
});
```
