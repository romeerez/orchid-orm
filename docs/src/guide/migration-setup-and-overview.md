# Migrations setup and overview

Migrations allow you to evolve your database schema over time. This migration toolkit has several benefits over writing raw SQL migrations or using other tools:

- write migrations in TypeScript, that enables performing insert queries and having any logic
- write only code to create or add something, and it will be automatically possible to undo the migration
- it shares the same column types library as the ORM, which allows you to write a `createTable` migration and copy-paste columns to your table class
- optionally, automatically updating table files of ORM after running a migration, instead of copy-pasting

## setup

It is already set up if you ran `npx orchid-orm@latest` command from a [quickstart](/guide/quickstart).

Install this migration tool by running:

```sh
npm i -D rake-db
```

::: info
`rake-db` is named after a command in Ruby on Rails because took some inspiration from it.
:::

Since the configuration is done in a regular TypeScript, it's possible to perform any logic and use any configuration tools to specify database connection options.

We suggest to keep database configuration options exported from a separate file, so it can be used both by migration tool and by `db` instance in a project.

Example structure (it's created automatically if you follow [quickstart](/guide/quickstart)):

```
src/
└── db/
    ├── migrations/ - contains migrations files that can be migrated or rolled back.
    │   ├── timestamp_createPost.ts
    │   └── timestamp_createComment.ts
    ├── baseTable.ts - for defining column type overrides.
    ├── config.ts - database credentials are exported from here.
    ├── db.ts - main file for the ORM, connects all tables into one `db` object.
    ├── dbScript.ts - script run by `npm run db *command*`.
    └── seed.ts - for filling tables with data.
```

Export database options:

In this example, `dotenv` is used and configured to first get env variables from `.env.local` and then to get them from the `.env` file.

```ts
// db/config.ts

import { config } from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';

config({ path: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env.local') });
config();

const database = {
  databaseURL: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  // ssl option can be set here or as a URL parameter on databaseURL
  ssl: true,
};
if (!database.databaseURL) throw new Error('DATABASE_URL is missing in .env');

export const config = {
  database,
};
```

Configure a `db` script:

```ts
// db/dbScript.ts

import { rakeDb } from 'rake-db';
import { appCodeUpdater } from 'orchid-orm';
import { config } from './config';
import { BaseTable } from './baseTable';

export const change = rakeDb(config.database, {
  // relative path to the current file:
  migrationsPath: '../migrations',
  // it also can be an absolute path:
  // migrationsPath: path.resolve(__dirname, 'migrations'),

  // column type overrides and snakeCase option will be taken from the BaseTable:
  baseTable: BaseTable,

  // optionally, for automatic code updating after running migrations:
  // baseTable is required when setting appCodeUpdater
  appCodeUpdater: appCodeUpdater({
    // paths are relative to the current file
    tablePath: (tableName) => `../tables/${tableName}.table.ts`,
    ormPath: './db.ts',
  }),

  // true by default, whether to use code updater by default
  useCodeUpdater: false,

  // custom commands can be defined as follows:
  commands: {
    // dbOptions is an array of database configs
    // config is the config of `rakeDb` (that contains migrationPath, appCodeUpdater, etc)
    // args of type string[] is an array of command line arguments startring after the command name
    async seed(dbOptions, config, args) {
      const { seed } = await import('./seed');
      await seed();
    },
  },
});
```

Add the `db` script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db": "ts-node src/db/dbScript.ts"
  }
}
```

And now it's possible to use it from a command line:

```sh
npm run db new createSomeTable
pnpm db new createSomeTable
yarn db new createSomeTable
```

## rakeDb

`rakeDb` function in the setup script takes connection options, migration config, and command line arguments:

```ts
const rakeDb = async (
  options: MaybeArray<AdapterOptions>,
  partialConfig?: Partial<MigrationConfig>,
  args: string[] = process.argv.slice(2),
) => {
  // ...
};
```

The first is of the same type `AdapterOptions` which is used when configuring the query builder and the ORM.
Provide an array of such options to migrate two and more databases at the same time, which helps maintain a test database.

The second optional argument of type `MigrationConfig`, all properties are optional, here is the type:

```ts
type MigrationConfig = {
  // columnTypes and snakeCase can be applied form ORM's BaseTable
  baseTable?: BaseTable;
  // or it can be set manually:
  columnTypes?: (t) => {
    // the same columnTypes config as in BaseTable definition
  };
  // set to true to have all columns named in camelCase in the app, but in snake_case in the db
  // by default, camelCase is expected in both app and db
  snakeCase?: boolean;

  // basePath and dbScript are determined automatically
  // basePath is a dir name of the file which calls `rakeDb`, and dbScript is a name of this file
  basePath?: string;
  dbScript?: string;

  // path to migrations directory
  migrationsPath?: string;

  // table in your database to store migrated versions
  migrationsTable?: string;

  // function to import typescript migration file
  import?(path: string): void;

  // specify behavior for what to do when no primary key was defined on a table
  noPrimaryKey?: 'error' | 'warn' | 'ignore';

  // log options, see "log option" in the query builder document
  log?: boolean | Partial<QueryLogObject>;
  // standard console by default
  logger?: {
    log(message: string): void;
    error(message: string): void;
  };

  appCodeUpdater?(params: {
    // abstract syntax tree of changes
    ast: RakeDbAst;
    // connection options
    options: AdapterOptions;
    // to resolve relative paths
    basePath: string;
    // the same object is passed between various appCodeUpdater calls
    cache: object;
    // the logger object from the above config
    // if log: false in the above config, logger is undefined
    logger?: {
      log(message: string): void;
      error(message: string): void;
    };
  }): Promise<void>;

  useCodeUpdater?: boolean;

  beforeMigrate?(db: Db): Promise<void>;
  afterMigrate?(db: Db): Promise<void>;
  beforeRollback?(db: Db): Promise<void>;
  afterRollback?(db: Db): Promise<void>;
};
```

To configure logging, see [log option](/guide/orm-and-query-builder#log-option) in the query builder document.

Note that `migrationsPath` can accept an absolute path, or a relative path to the current file.

Defaults are:

- `basePath` is the dir name of the file you're calling `rakeDb` from
- `migrationPath` is `src/db/migrations`
- `migrationsTable` is `schemaMigrations`
- `snakeCase` is `false`, so camelCase is expected in both the app and the database
- `import` will use a standard `import` function
- `noPrimaryKey` is `error`, it'll bite if you accidentally forgot to add a primary key to a new table
- `log` is on
- `logger` is a standard `console`
- `useCodeUpdater` is `true`, but it won't run anything if you don't specify `appCodeUpdater` config

The third optional argument of `rakeDb` is an array of strings from the command line, by default it will use `process.argv` to get the arguments, but you can override it by passing arguments manually.

## snakeCase

By default, this option is `false` and camelCase is expected in a database, change it to `true` if all or most of the columns in your database are in snake_case.

When `snakeCase` is `true`, all column names in migrations will be translated into snake_case automatically.

It changes behavior of `db pull` command at handling column names and timestamps, see [db pull](/guide/migration-commands#pull) for details.

## appCodeUpdater

`appCodeUpdater` is a module that will add new and update existing project files when running migrations.

To prevent running when not needed, append `--code false` flag to cli command:

```sh
npm run db migrate --code false
```

If you don't want to run it on every migration, set `useCodeUpdater` to false and run migration with `--code` flag to run code updater when needed:

```sh
npm run db migrate --code
```

What `appCodeUpdater` does:

- creates base table file if it doesn't exist
- creates main `db` file if it doesn't exist
- creates a new table file when creating a table
- adds table entry to `db` file when creating a table
- adds new columns, indexes, and foreign keys to the table file when they are added in a migration
- changes columns, indexes, and foreign keys in the table file when they are changed in a migration
- changes `table` and `schema` property in the table file when renaming a table
- removes table entry from `db` file when dropping a table

`appCodeUpdater` does **not** delete or rename existing files, because it is better to be done manually.
A modern editor will update all file usage in imports across the project when renaming a file or an exported class.

## seeds

To make database seeds, create own script with the needed logic.

In the example, new db instance is constructed with `createDb`,
but you can import `db` object from where it's defined in your app.

```ts
// db/seed.ts
import { db } from './db';

export const seed = async () => {
  await db.table.createMany([{ name: 'record 1' }, { name: 'record 2' }]);

  await db.close();
};
```

Add a custom command to `rake-db` config:

```ts
// db/dbScript

// ...snip imports

export const change = rakeDb(config.database, {
  // ...other options

  commands: {
    async seed(options) {
      const { seed } = await import('./seed');
      await seed();
    },
  },
});
```

Run the seeds with the command:

```sh
npm run db seed
# or
pnpm db seed
```

## before and after callbacks

To run custom code before or after `migrate` or `rollback` command, define functions in `rakeDb` config object:

Supported callbacks are `beforeMigrate`, `afterMigrate`, `beforeRollback`, `afterRollback`.

Example: each time when `npm run db migrate` is run, after the migration was successfully applied, this will create new records of a specific table if it is empty.

If `options` is an array of multiple database configs, callbacks are run for each of the databases.

```ts
export const change = rakeDb(options, {
  async afterMigrate(db: Db) {
    const haveRecords = await db('table').exists();
    if (!haveRecords) {
      await db('table').createMany([
        { name: 'one' },
        { name: 'two' },
        { name: 'three' },
      ]);
    }
  },
});
```
